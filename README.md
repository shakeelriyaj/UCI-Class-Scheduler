Hello!

I am currently a student at the University of California, Irvine where I am majoring in
Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering. I created this project because
recently, while enrolling for classes, I was unable to join the class that I wanted due
to size restrictions. 

Instead of refreshing and looking for an open class during my winter break, I wanted
to automate that task and create a web scraper that went into my schools website,
found the correct class that I am looking for and sent an email to me if there was an
opening. 

This taught me a lot about web scraping and how that worked, along with Googles OAuth,
and sending emails using the smtp method!

Hopefully, this helps you in your future projects. :)
